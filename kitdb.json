The kit offers a set of tools designed around powerful heuristics that offers a range between zero configuration to advanced cross content workflows. Each markdown file that the kit exports is processed and converted into a static HTML file, saved in the kit folder you configured. Once a file, or files from a directory/vault, are exported, you can publish/deploy the kit folder to any hosting provider. The Kit, as its name implies, is just a kit, and doesn't provide hosting. The kit embraces the static experience and is meant to be deployed at the edge of CDN's. They offer ultra-high speed delivery of your content to the users, worldwide, for free. Static apps are delivered at nearly instant speed, making for very consistent and pleasant browsing experiences.  usage Using the PKM plugin over the CLI has the advantage of benefiting from the PKM internal features. For example, Obsidian users can use the wonderful dataview plugin to build out their content, and the queries will get published nicely. Unlike the CLI who parses and exports the markdown into HTML, the PKM integration bypass the markdown processing, and only processes the PKM HTML render, allowing PKM plugins transformations to be publishable. Yes my friend! Currently, only Obsidian is supported. More pkm's on the way. exporting In the kit folder, the converted files, alongside linked assets like images & PDFs, will mirror the same folder structure as their respective source file. Exported, the file blog/myarticle.md in your vault folder, will be located at blog/myarticle.html in the kit folder. They are regular html. They contain a header, a script pointing to the kit source, and the actual html content. The content is wrapped in a <template id=\"content\" /> tag, and is only made visible after the page has loaded and the plugins have all registred. kit preview Before deploying your changes to your hosting provider, you can live preview your kit application locally in your browser. Assuming you have nodejs installed on your machine, open your terminal, navigate to your kit folder and run:  Use the cli kit serve command to go faster and open up the browser automatically. You can also specify the port pk serve -p 1337 publishing The kit can be hosted anywhere.

In that case, just provide an init method to your plugin class. deps The deps method let you include external dependencies, like js et css files. The method can be a flat array, or a function, if you need access to props. It's also possible to push a depedency inside the constructor: style The style function is where you style your components. You can write vanilla css, or lesscss. render The render method is where you can register UI components. transform This is where it's appropriate to do all kind of dom manipulation.

Plugins are the Kit core design. Without any plugins, content is rendered as is, without any transformations, onto the page. But with plugins, that's where the magic begins. Plugins can do anything, from fully tweaking and theming the UI, to creating and binding UI elements, or just exposing functions for other plugins to consume. The Kit comes equipped with some core plugins out of the box. Other plugins are imagined and delivered by the community. usage Plugins can be added and overrided, taking precedence, in the frontmatter of the following files: To register a plugin, in the frontmatter of the files mentioned above, add a key value pair under the plugins YAML object. Use the plugin name for the key, and set a true value. Ex: Plugins can come from different places, they can be: Only core and local plugins can register by simply specifying a true value. That's because they are included in the kit (for core plugins) or auto resolve (for local plugins).  The community plugins can be included by prefixing the name with a @ sign. The external plugins just have to specify their location with a URL. So, depending on where the plugin lives, you will register it differently. Example with the ga plugin: local plugins They have to be located in the kit_local/plugins folder at the root of your kit. Ex:  community plugins It turns out the ga plugin is an actual community plugin, that you can use right now. I would suggest adding this particular plugin in your kitrc, so all your pages can benefit from the tracking.  You can of course, in any of your pages, override or disable the plugin: options Plugins can have options. For example, the ga community plugin takes a Google tracking id. At the root of the frontmatter, create a YAML object with the plugin name, and provide the option in a key: value way: For single option plugins, short syntax can be used: life cycle Plugins are orchestrated in the following way: In fact, those are the 8 lines of code that compose the kit main function.
