By using the PKM internal features & plugins, like [[wiki links]] or dataview queries, you can generate content faster, and augment your pages. Combined with the kit plugins, you can shape and ship all kinds of web apps from a single tool. The kit renders your content into static HTML pages, inside a folder, that can be hosted anywhere. Project documentations, blogs, wikis, digital gardens, academia, table-top games, shops... The kit just seats on top of your content, and gives you full control over the UI & UX. Welcome to the kit !

In a javascript file, return a class defining your plugin, and set default options if the plugin has options. lifecycle When a plugin is registered, it goes through the following optionnal life cycles, each of them giving you an opportunity to define your plugin. init Some plugins may require some initialisation before they get rendered. In that case, just provide an init method to your plugin class. deps The deps method let you include external dependencies, like js et css files. The method can be a flat array, or a function, if you need access to props. It's also possible to push a depedency inside the constructor: style The style function is where you style your components. You can write vanilla css, or lesscss. render The render method is where you can register UI components. transform This is where it's appropriate to do all kind of dom manipulation. All plugins have rendered, but can still be transformed. bind The bind method is the last cycle, and is where you bind your UI components and make them dynamic.

Plugins are the core design principle of the Kit. Without any plugins, content is rendered as is, without any transformations, onto the page. But with plugins, that's where the magic begins. Plugins can do anything. From fully tweaking and theming the UI, to creating and binding UI elements, or just exposing functions for other plugins to consume. The kit comes equipped with some core plugins out of the box. Other plugins are imagined and delivered by the community. Everything in the kit is a plugin. Combined, plugins can deliver powerful characteristics, like turning independent static pages into fully featured web apps. usage Plugins can be added and overrided, taking precedence, in the frontmatter of the following files: To register a plugin, in the frontmatter of the files mentioned above, add a key value pair under the plugins YAML object. Use the plugin name for the key, and set a true value. Ex: Note that only core and local plugins can register by simply specifying a true value. That's because they are included in the kit (for core plugins) or auto resolve (for local plugins).  community plugins can just prefix the plugin name with a @ sign, and external plugins have to specify their location with a URL. So, depending on where the plugin lives, you will register it differently. Example with the ga plugin: local plugins They have to be located in the kit_local/plugins folder at the root of your kit. Ex:  community plugins It turns out the ga plugin is an actual community plugin, that you can use right now. I would suggest adding this particular plugin in your kitrc config, so all your pages can benefit from the tracking.  You can of course, in any page, override the kitrc config or disable the plugin like so: options Plugins can have options. For example, the ga community plugin takes a Google tracking id. At the root of the frontmatter, create a YAML object with the plugin name, and provide the option in a key value manner: For single option plugins, short syntax can be used: life cycle Plugins are orchestrated in the following way: In fact, those are the 8 lines of code that compose the kit main function.
