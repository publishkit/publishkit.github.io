The kit renders markdown into minimals or fully featured static web apps, ready to be hosted on the edge.  Project documentations, blogs, wikis, digital gardens, academia, table-top games, even shops... The kit just seats on top of your content, and gives you full control over the UI & UX via declarative plugins configuration. Plugins are the buildings block of the kit whose main function is to register plugins. Everything in the framework is a plugin, that can create context inside, around & across pages. By just tagging a plugin in your content, you enable tailored experiences & features on the web pages, in seconds, without a line of code. Plugins are to the kit what blocks are to Minecraft. They can be built on top of and cross interact with other plugins, which implies that complex, meta, and creative usecases and concepts can be invented.  Welcome to the kit ! We hope you'll have as fun publishing your content as we're having crafting this project. features Core features: Community features: Obsidian features:  summary PublishKit is targeted at markdown users looking to publish any kind of projects. The kit power resides in the Ui & Ux features it provides to the content.  By just tagging some plugins in the frontmatter of a markdown file, you enable wich features the published content will gain. By combining plugins, you can build very powerful use cases and applications.  The kit converts markdown files into static html files for you to host anywhere you want. This kit (this website) is hosted on github pages, and powers content created via Obsidian. The kit is fully programmable from the outside, and can be entirely abstracted and integrated into open PKM applications. get started about PublishKit is developed by a french based indie tech studio named Studio1337. We are passionnate folks with more then 20 years of tech expertise. We craft and design unique software, taking the time to build first class solutions, towards sustainabilty & self expression. PublishKit is our current full time project. We are actively focused on delivering high value to our users & community. We'd love to hear from you.

Plugins are the core design principle of PublishKit. Without any plugins, content is rendered as is, without any transformations, onto the page. But with plugins, that's where the magic begins. Plugins can do anything. From fully tweaking and theming the UI, to creating and binding ui elements, or just exposing functions for other plugins to consume. The kit comes equiped with some core plugins out of the box. Other plugins are imagined and delivered by the community. Everything in the kit is a plugin. Combined, plugins can delivers powerful characteristics, like turning independant static pages into fully featured web apps. usage Plugins can be added and overided, taking precedence, in the frontmatter of the following files: To register a plugin, in the frontmatter of any of the files mentionned above, add a key value pair under the plugins yaml object. Use the plugin name for the key, and set a true value. Ex: Note that only core and local plugins can register by simply specifying a true value. That's because their are included in the kit (for core plugins) or auto resolve (for local plugins).  community plugins can just prefix the plugin name with a @ sign, and external plugins have to specify their location with an url. So depending on where the plugin live, you will register it differently. Exemple with the ga plugin: local plugins They have to be located in the kit_local/plugins folder at the root of your kit. Ex:  community plugins It turns out the ga plugin is an actual community plugin, that you can use right now. I would suggest adding this particular plugin in your kitrc config, so all your pages can benefit from the tracking.  You can of course, in any page, overide the kitrc config or disable the plugin like so: options Plugins can have options. For exemple the ga community plugin takes a google tracking id. At the root of the frontmatter, create a yaml object with the plugin name, and provide the option in a key value manner: For single option plugins, short syntax can be used: api","eat":"2023-02-14T15:07:36.342Z"},"79cdd07738fe5723040ec3e359a83ccd":{"path":"theme/index.md","filename":"index.md","ext":"md","hash":"79cdd07738fe5723040ec3e359a83ccd","url":"theme/index.html","type":"note","title":"Theme","tags":[],"text":"theme Configure theme use customize live demo default theme: matrix theme:","eat":"2023-02-14T15:07:36.855Z"},"643f23a79748027ef00d96b77e29b9e6":{"path":"plugins/core/og.md","filename":"og.md","ext":"md","hash":"643f23a79748027ef00d96b77e29b9e6","url":"plugins/core/og.html","type":"note","title":"og","tags":[],"text":"og Configure open graph properties use","eat":"2023-02-14T15:07:32.195Z"},"b092ce626c9004b6b8ae0b222871a77c":{"path":"pricing.md","filename":"pricing.md","ext":"md","hash":"b092ce626c9004b6b8ae0b222871a77c","url":"pricing.html","type":"note","title":"Pricing","tags":[],"text":"Pricing free perso pro about kits invoicing Our payment provider chargebee, is a service that simplifies subscriptions based payments, on top of a stripe or Paypal account.
